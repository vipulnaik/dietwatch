His dietary decision: "So my diet will consist of vegan food plus shellfish, insects, wild-caught fish, pasture-raised birds/mammals (and their eggs/whey/butter). I will assume vertebrate animals are raised in cruel conditions unless they’re clearly marked as wild-caught, grass-fed, or pasture-raised." McCluskey expects to be able to stick to this diet while at home, but expects to not be able to adhere to these constraints in large social gatherings. He plans to cap calorie consumption of food outside these constraints to 120 calories per month'),

Rather, the relevant comparison is between the maximum benefit that can be achieved for the same cost. For instance, in many cases, eating more frugally and donating the savings to a suitable charity may generate more value for the same personal cost.

His model involves a number of inputs, including the degree of moral importance, quality of life, number of animals consumed per human, climate change impact, and elasticity. He explains why he was unable to use Luke Muehlhauser''s probability-of-sentience estimates https://www.openphilanthropy.org/2017-report-consciousness-and-moral-patienthood (these only give a probability and no moral weight for degrees of consciousness). He also explains that he did not use Brian Tomasik''s quality-of-life estimates because of Tomasik''s focus only on suffering and not on happiness.

She articulates a framework of three principles guiding her position: secularism (in the sense of respect for preferences one does not share), anti-outrage (not using outrage to measure the strengths of people''s preferences), and official sanction (there shouldn''t be official sanction for actions that violate the beliefs of a large subset of the group). Piper argues that many people passionate about animal welfare were deeply unhappy about meat being served at the conference, but did not express outrage, partly because of the general culture against outrage in the EA community. Piper appreciates this (she does not like the outrage culture in some social justice circles) but highlights the need for alternative ways to understand and accommodate the strength of people''s preferences and beliefs'),

He says: "I wish people would spend less time talking about small scale personal consumption ethics like veganism. I think that these topics encourage a type of thinking which is very different to the type of thinking that is most important for EA. I worry that when new EAs run into these arguments, they think that the types of arguments used there are the most important types of arguments, and so don’t learn the important of getting deep understanding of topics relevant to EA." He also notes: "I am less enthusiastic about hedonic utilitarianism than I used to be. I don’t regret naming my DAF the Hedonium Shockwave Fund, but it’s much more of a joke now. I’m more inclined to care about complex value, and I think I might start thinking that death of humans is terminally bad."
