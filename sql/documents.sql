His chain of reasoning is: animals can suffer, factory farming causes considerable suffering, vegetarianism can make a difference, and vegetarianism is easier than you think. He concludes with a challenge to people to try being vegetarian for a while, or least try to be reducetarian (eat less meat) or eat meat from bigger animals, resulting in less suffering per unit food consumed'),

The discussion includes Yudkowsky''s interpretation of consciousness, and why he considers it unlikely that pigs have sufficient reflective self-awareness to have the "inner listener" necessary for moral worth, i.e., it''s not that they have simpler qualia, it''s that they don''t have qualia at all. He also discusses the mind projection fallacy, linking to https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZTRiSNmeGQK8AkdN2/mind-projection-fallacy The comments include pushback from a number of directions. Topics discussed include the mirror test, how to deal with a reasonable probability of being wrong, the distinction between pain and suffering, and the work of others who have written about consciousness, including Gary Drescher. Brian Tomasik is inspired to edit one of his existing articles based on the discussion: http://reducing-suffering.org/which-computations-do-i-care-about/#disagreements David Pearce calls Eliezer''s argument an example of an ethically catastrophic error'),

In particular, she argues that the relevant comparison is not whether the personal cost of forgoing meat is exceeded by the benefits of being vegetarian (in terms of reduced animal suffering or reduced animal deaths). Rather, the relevant comparison is between the maximum benefit that can be achieved for the same cost. For instance, in many cases, eating more frugally and donating the savings to a suitable charity may generate more value for the same personal cost. The post attracts 44 comments, many of which push back against the claims in the post. Commenters include David Pearce, Brian Tomasik, Boris Yakubchik, and Magnus Vinding. Some of the points of pushback include: the relative value of human and animal suffering, the probability that animals are conscious, the health effects of vegetarianism, and the value of vegetarians as early adopters who help create a market for vegetarian products'),

She offers the following reasons for going vegan: (1) Impact of her diet on animal suffering, (2) Not wanting to be part of the factory farming enterprise, (3) Signalling and encouraging others. She offers the following arguments against: (1) Inconvenience, enjoyment, willpower, (2) Health, (3) No need to be all-or-nothing. She then asks the commenters if there are other considerations she is missing. In the comments, Paul Christiano, Brian Tomasik, Peter Hurford, and others argue against lumping together milk and eggs, and suggest a focus on cutting out eggs (i.e., becoming a lacto-vegetarian). Rob Wiblin also notes that he switched from veganism to lacto-vegetarianism + having mussels. Tom Ash notes in the comments that he is in a similar situation as Jess. Michael Dickens argues that being vegan for a few months will make it easier to be vegan in the long term'),

He discusses possible responses to both'),

He says he would need about $500/year to go vegetarian and $2,000/year to go vegan. Then, he looks at existing estimates of how much it would cost to convince others to go vegetarian, and finds estimates much lower than that. An update includes an estimate https://reducing-suffering.org/donating-toward-efficient-online-veg-ads/ from Brian Tomasik. However, in an update to the post, Kaufman notes that he has revised upward his estimate of this cost'),

She talks about this in the context of eating meat, where she thinks meat-eaters often ignore animal suffering in order to feel comfortable about eating meat. She describes her own past experiment of going vegan except for ice cream, which was not perfect but reduced her amount of animal product consumption by quite a bit compared to not trying the experiment at all'),

Palmer',NULL,NULL,'Personal journey|Case against animal consumption','On his personal blog, Tom G. Palmer explains that he has become vegetarian for ethical reasons. He discusses the logic of the larder argument (i.e., that many of the factory-farmed animals would not have been bred otherwise) but argues that our obligation not to mistreat animals trumps such calculations. He also notes the free-range meat is less objectionable, and some creatures such as shrimp and oysters may be okay to eat because they lack a central nervous system. He also notes that he does not believe in animal rights analogous to human rights, simply that animals should not be mistreated. He suggests Matthew Scully’s book "Dominion: The Power of Man, the Suffering of Animals, and the Call to Mercy" for more insight');
