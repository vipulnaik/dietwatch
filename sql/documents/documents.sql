She offers the following arguments against: (1) Inconvenience, enjoyment, willpower, (2) Health, (3) No need to be all-or-nothing. She then asks the commenters if there are other considerations she is missing. In the comments, Paul Christiano, Brian Tomasik, Peter Hurford, and others argue against lumping together milk and eggs, and suggest a focus on cutting out eggs (i.e., becoming a lacto-vegetarian). Rob Wiblin also notes that he switched from veganism to lacto-vegetarianism + having mussels. Tom Ash notes in the comments that he is in a similar situation as Jess. Michael Dickens argues that being vegan for a few months will make it easier to be vegan in the long term.'),

In particular, she argues that the relevant comparison is not whether the personal cost of forgoing meat is exceeded by the benefits of being vegetarian (in terms of reduced animal suffering or reduced animal deaths). Rather, the relevant comparison is between the maximum benefit that can be achieved for the same cost. For instance, in many cases, eating more frugally and donating the savings to a suitable charity may generate more value for the same personal cost. The post attracts 44 comments, many of which push back against the claims in the post. Commenters include David Pearce, Brian Tomasik, Boris Yakubchik, and Magnus Vinding.

In the previous post, she gives reasons for believing that bivalves are not sentient, and that bivalve production does not cause more animal harm than agriculture. In the new post, she argues for encouraging wider acceptance of bivalve consumption among vegans. She notes that this undermines the case that vegans are motivated purely by disgust.

Tomasik agrees that the suffering per creature for bivalves is likely less than for most other creatures, but he thinks that their sensory systems make it possible that they do experience suffering. Moreover, given the huge numbers of bivalves that need to be consumed in a single meal, he is concerned that overall, a diet with bivalves might cause nontrivial levels of animal suffering. However, he agrees with Fleischman that "if eating bivalves significantly helps you avoid backsliding toward eating large numbers of clearly sentient animals like chickens, it''s plausibly an acceptable moral risk to take." Fleischman praises the response at https://www.facebook.com/sentientist/posts/10109086644658140 saying "Brian Tomasik is the first person who has used actual evidence to try to refute my position that bivalves don''t suffer."
